# Quatro Desktop Client

A native desktop wrapper over Quatro - [https://usequatro.com](https://usequatro.com).

## Note

ðŸŸ¡ This package isn't how the Quatro desktop app is built at this time.

The Quatro desktop app is built with [ToDesktop](https://www.todesktop.com/). ToDesktop handles code signing and native installers, which is extremely convenient for us. Check it out!

```bash
npm run build -- --platform=mac -- --environment=production
```
